# RNN-Jax
Implementation of various flavours of recurrent neural networks in Jax and Equinox

# TODOs:

- Add more cells:
  - [ ] non normal RNN https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12080
  - [ ] clockwork RNN https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3511
  - [x] lipschitz RNN https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12070
  - [x] anti-symmetric RNN https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09689
  - ...

- [x] Bidirectional layer
- [x] Deep architectures (bidirectional or not)
- [ ] Examples and benchmarks
  - [x] Adding task
  - [ ] Copy task
  - [ ] Dynamical system forecasting
  - [ ] Pixel-by-pixel image classification
  - **Advanced**: Char-level language modeling 

- Advanced
  - Linear recurrence models (SSM and LRU)
  - Neural ODEs
  - Transformer / RNN hybrids
